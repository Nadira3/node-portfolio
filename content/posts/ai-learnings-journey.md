# My 60-Day Learning Journey: Building Foundations in Statistics & Machine Learning

Welcome to my 60‚ÄëDay Learning Journey! Over the next two months, I will be strengthening my statistics fundamentals and machine learning skills through a structured plan using free resources and practical side projects. This document outlines my goals, daily tasks, milestones, and projects.

---

## **Overall Goals**

- **Solidify Statistical Foundations:**  
  - Review basic descriptive and inferential statistics (using Khan Academy).
  - Learn key concepts in linear regression, classification, and model evaluation from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* (ISTL).

- **Build Practical Machine Learning Skills:**  
  - Complete Kaggle‚Äôs ‚ÄúIntro to Machine Learning‚Äù micro-course.
  - Begin Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine Learning course (audit mode) and re‚Äëimplement models in Python.

- **Develop a Portfolio:**  
  - Create and document side projects (e.g., two-way table analysis on heart failure dataset, building baseline models).
  - Save code and visualizations on GitHub along with explanatory blog posts.

### Day 2:

# Exploring & Visualizing Distributions  

## üìå Overview  
This project explores key statistical concepts related to **data distribution** and **visualization techniques** using real-world datasets. The goal is to analyze numerical data through different graphical representations, identify patterns, and interpret insights.  

## üìñ Concepts Covered  
- **Stem-and-Leaf Plots:** Representing numerical data in a compact format to visualize distributions.  
- **Bar Charts & Histograms:** Comparing categorical and numerical distributions.  
- **Clusters, Gaps, Peaks, and Outliers:** Detecting patterns and irregularities in datasets.  
- **Centers & Spreads:** Understanding measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variability (range, IQR, standard deviation).  
- **Comparing Distributions:** Visualizing differences between data groups.  

## üéØ Project Tasks  
1. **Dataset Selection:** Choose or create a dataset containing numerical values (e.g., patient ages, test results).  
2. **Manual Analysis:**  
   - Construct a **stem-and-leaf plot**.  
   - Identify **clusters, gaps, peaks, and outliers**.  
   - Summarize central tendencies and spreads.  
3. **Python Implementation:**  
   - Load the dataset using **Pandas**.  
   - Generate a **bar chart, histogram, and box plot** using **Matplotlib/Seaborn**.  
   - Use `df.describe()` to obtain summary statistics.  
4. **Interpret Findings:**  
   - Compare distributions across groups.  
   - Identify trends, skewness, or irregularities.  
   - Document observations and insights.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for implementation  
- **GitHub** for project documentation  

## üìÇ How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook.


## üìà Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will:
- ‚úÖ Gain hands-on experience with data visualization and distribution analysis.
- ‚úÖ Improve your ability to identify patterns and interpret statistical data.
- ‚úÖ Develop foundational Python skills for data analysis in computational medicine.
